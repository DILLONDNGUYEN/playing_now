# playing_now
This is a simple Playlist making app.  Users are able to search for a song and said song on to a list as if it were a playlist. The Music Player feature will work as a placeholder and will be functioning in future updates.

Installation and Running:

1. Fork and Clone Repo
2. Start the postgresql Server in the Backend 'sudo service postgresql start'
3. Start the Rails Server in the the Backend 'rails s'
4. Open Live Server in the Frontend  (I use Open Live Server by right clicking into the html file)
